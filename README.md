# Pure-SU-2-Lattice-Gauge-Theory
As part of the Research Scholarship Project at the University of Edinburgh, this project develops a MCMC simulation for 2D pure SU(2) Yang-Mills theory, implements Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to generate gauge field configurations, and computed Wilson loops to study confinement and static quark potential.
